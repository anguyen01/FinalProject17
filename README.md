    Welcome to Survival. In this game, you play as a survivor in the wastelands.
Your goal is to survive for 15 turns. Every turn, a random number is selected.
Based on that number, a scenario is chosen. You survive the scenario depending
on what action you take and what items you have. For example, you may
successfully defend against a bandit attack when you have a gun but may die if
you lack a gun. Most scenarios have pre-determined choices, while others may
have choices the player can type in themselves.
